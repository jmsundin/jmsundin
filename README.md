# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I value:
- learning/planning
- acting -- and subsequently learning by acting
- repeating this virtuous cycle
- helping others learn

My view: Learning best occurs when the greatest number of associations can be made in your brain -- i.e. by doing something, you experience the most relevant inputs, and these are the associations that provide "hooks" for learning. So, I aim to have a bias towards action rather than overthinking -- unless the action is thinking :)

Here is my framework:

## Infoverse AI

My passion project is called ([Infoverse AI](https://infoverse.ai)). Currently, the web application enables users to search Wikipedia and visualize topics as a graph network as well as view Wikipedia articles in a split-pane view. The goal is to provide the user with a top-down view of a topic, with the capactity to interact with information in an increasingly detailed fashion -- as the user desires. If you hover over a graph node, a brief description of the node topic is shown, and if a Wikipedia article is available on the topic, you can select the Wikipedia icon to open the split-pane view to read the article.
