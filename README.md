### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jon Sundin. I am interested in utilizing computers to leverage human intellect to solve problems.

Iâ€™m currently working on [infoverse.ai](https://infoverse.ai). My current goal for this project is to provide an increasingly detailed interaction with information as the user desires -- seeing a brief description of a topic after hovering over or selecting a node/topic and seeing a menu of options to see the sub-topics under or connected to the selected topic.

I am building Infoverse AI with React.js, Vis-Network (Vis.js), and vanilla CSS.
