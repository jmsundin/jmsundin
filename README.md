### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jon Sundin. I am passionate about utilizing the intellectual leveraging ability of computers to solve human problems.

Iâ€™m currently working on [infoverse.ai](https://infoverse.ai). My current goal for this project is to provide a seamless interface for users to explore hierarchical information in a non-linear form (network diagram and tree chart) as well as the usual linear written form. I am building infoverse.ai with React.js, D3.js, Vis.js, and modern CSS.
