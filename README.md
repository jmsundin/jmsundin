# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jon Sundin. I am interested in utilizing computers to solve problems.

## Infoverse AI

My passion project is called ([Infoverse AI](https://infoverse.ai)). Currently, the web application enables users to search Wikipedia and visualize topics as a graph network as well as view Wikipedia articles in a split-pane view. The goal is to provide the user with a top-down view of a topic, with the capactity to interact with information in an increasingly detailed fashion -- as the user desires. If you hover over a graph node, a brief description of the node topic is shown, and if a Wikipedia article is available on the topic, you can select the Wikipedia icon to open the split-pane view to read the article.
